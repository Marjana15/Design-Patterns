# Command Pattern

In a Unix-based computer system, a file management module oversees tasks like file opening and writing. "OpenFileCommand" and "WriteFileCommand" serve as separate commands to manage these actions. These commands are executed via a "FileInvoker." Initially, the "OpenFileCommand" triggers file opening on the Unix system, while subsequently designating the "WriteFileCommand" facilitates data writing. This design, employing the Command Pattern, permits the easy adaptation of file operations across diverse systems by altering the receiver and command implementations.
